COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, affecting nearly every aspect of life. From public health and government policies to social behavior and the global economy, the repercussions of the pandemic have been far-reaching and continue to unfold. In this project, Iâ€™ve analyzed a COVID-19 dataset to gain insights into the global spread of the virus, the effectiveness of various responses, and the socio-economic consequences
